        <p>This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water-we're talking about quick and easy options here.
             These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person-use whatever shape you've got.
              Or, check out my super simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions</li>
            <li style="color: brown;">Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing ocassionally, the turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, and finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well</li>
            <li>Use ngs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss</li>
            <li>Pour the Parmesan eggs into a pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</li>
            <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan</li>
